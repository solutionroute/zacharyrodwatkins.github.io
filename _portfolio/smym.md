Show me Your Moves is a Python API for creating custom Super Smash Bros. AIs. 
We run Super Smash Bros. Melee in an emulated environment and read memory address directly from RAM. With the backend written in C++, we provide a Python API for reading various in-game parameters (e.g. health, player location, etc...), as well as inputting commands (e.g. jump, move, attack, etc...)
