* B.A.Sc in Engineering Physics, University of British Columbia 2022, with distinction

Experience
======
* Express Remote Sensing (September 2020 - December 2022): Computer Vision Engineer 
  * Used various Machine Learning and Signal Processing techniques to delineate roads, buildings, rivers and railroads in LIDAR and aerial photography.
  * Improved efficiency by creating intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow processors to interact with my automation tools easily.  
  * Reduced time employees spent sorting through data by developing models that rank images by relevance.
