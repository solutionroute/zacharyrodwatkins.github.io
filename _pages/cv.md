Education
======
* B.A.S.C in Engineering Physics, University of British Columbia 2022

Experience
======
* Express Remote Sensing (September 2020 - December 2022): Computer Vision Engineer 
  * Used various Machine Learning and Signal Processing techniques to delineate roads, buildings, rivers and railroads in LIDAR and aerial photography.
  * Improved efficiency by creating intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow processors to easily interact with my automation tools.  
  * Reduced time employees spent sorting through data by developing models that rank images by relevance. 

* Sierra Wireless (May - September 2020): Software Developer Co-op
  * Introduced support for RMNET Kernel driver, allowing for host software systems to be used on a new suite of Qualcomm chips.
  * Developed a tool to monitor CPU usage by a given driver across multiple processes, and multiple remote devices
  * Introduced automated documentation tools that allowed for easy creation of high quality documentation

* National Research Council (January - April 2019): Machine Learning for Astronomy Co-op 
  * Designed and trained Neural Networks to predict the metallicity of Stars from photometry. 
  * This novel technique increased the accuracy of correctly predicting low-metallicity stars from 20\% to 60\%.
